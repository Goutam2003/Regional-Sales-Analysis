# Regional-Sales-Analysis
🚀 Turned Raw Sales Data into Strategic Insights!
Just completed a hands-on Data Analysis project titled "Sales Data Analysis", where I combined Python, Power BI, and visual storytelling to
convert unstructured sales data into a business-ready dashboard.

🔍 What I Did:

Collected and merged real-world sales data from a GitHub repo (multiple tables)
Cleaned, structured, and engineered new features using Jupyter Notebook
Designed a custom dashboard layout in Canva Brought it to life in Power BI using calculated measures & transformations

📊 Key Highlights:

Identified Top Revenue Customers, Net Profit, Total Revenue, and Profit
Margins

Created an interactive dashboard that’s simple enough for business
teams, yet rich in insights

Focused on the core: what drives growth & revenue in a sales environment

💡 The goal? To build a solution that speaks the language of business —
data-backed, visually clear, and decision-oriented.

👨‍💻 Tools used: Python | Pandas | Power BI | Canva | Jupyter Notebook

🔗 Excited to take this experience into real-world analytics roles where
data isn’t just viewed — it’s understood and acted upon.
